/**
 * Scope
 * An important idea in programming is scope. Scope defines where variables can be accessed or referenced.

  * Blocks and Scope
  * 
  * A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. 
  * Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an important structural marker for our code.

/**
 * Global Scope
 * 
 * Scope is the context in which our variables are declared.
 * We think about scope in relation to blocks because variables can exist either outside of or within these blocks.
 * In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks. These variables are called global variables.
 * Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.

 * Variables that are declared with block scope are known as local variables because they are only

/**
 * Scope Pollution
 * 
 * It may seem like a great idea to always make your variables accessible, 
 * but having too many global variables can cause problems in a program.
 * When you declare global variables, they go to the global namespace.
 * The global namespace allows the variables to be accessible from anywhere in the program.
 * These variables remain there until the program finishes which means our global namespace can fill up really quickly.
 * Scope pollution is when we have too many global variables that exist in the global namespace,
 * or when we reuse variables across different scopes.
 * Scope pollution makes it difficult to keep track of our different variables and sets us up for potential accidents.
 * For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more locally scoped,
 * causing unexpected behavior in our code.
